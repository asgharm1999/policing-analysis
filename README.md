We are a team of students at Carnegie Mellon University. We are working with CampaignZero to provide data driven policy decisons on policing. Initially we looked at ShotSpotter and Mapping Police Violence data. We compared populations of similar size and how police responded in each city. 

Our focus then shifted into Excited Delirium (https://phr.org/our-work/resources/excited-delirium) to test our hypothesis that police killings of civilian deaths are substantially undercounted. The goal of the project is to analyze the CDC's NVSS mortality data to identify instances of excited delirium and quantify their prevalence. We'd like to compare how frequent excited delirium is as a cause of death and the frequency of police killings documented from media reports (ie, MPV, Fatal Encounters, Washington Post). We'd also like to see if this can help us identify instances of fatal police violence that are unaccounted for in the major databases.

Please view the visualizations as a means of understanding policing concerns in the United States.
